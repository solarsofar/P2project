	<p>I'm a computer science student in love with digital culture.I enjoy the simple things in life. Being happy is a state of mind, and I don't think people should settle for less than they deserve.</br> 
	   I always look toward the next best thing. I've been through more than most people my age, but hey, it's what has made me stronger.</br>
           Life has thrown me challenges, and so far, I've come out on top.</br> 
	   I realized who my real friends are, and that my family always comes first..always. Computer science is a passion of mine. I love music and movies. </br>
	   I'm average, and that's okay.
   </p>
