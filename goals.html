    	<p>My long-term goals involve </br>
		growing as a person and find inspiration to continue to learn,</br> 
		take on additional responsibilities, and contribute as much value as possible to the communnity.</br> 
		I would take full advantage of the educational resources available.         
	</p>
<h1>Goals for my Computer Science Major</h1>
<ul><li>Be able to apply problem solving skills to general problems into precise algorithmic solutions</li>
<li>Become a proficient programmer</li>
<li>Have a broad exposure to computer systems</li>
<li>Have experience conducting research and completing large projects; often those projects will require a team effort</li>
<li>Be able to apply the computational and algorithmic problem solving skills learned in computer science across many situations</li>
</ul> 
	<p>In the short term,</br> 
		one of my goals is to continue developing my writing skills. I want to express my ideas.</br> 
		In addition, I would like to raise my hand for more speaking and presentational assignments, since I know that written and verbal communication skills often work together.</br> 
		I would love to apply this skill set to establish a solid foundation for the future.</p>
