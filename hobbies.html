<p>	I'm not that interesting so don't expect too much.</br> 
		My hobbies have always been gaming, watching anime and generally mucking around on my pc, as such I find it fitting that I should tell you about such things.</br> 
		I honestly had not much of a life before I came to Highschool, so telling you about the things I used to consume my time with and my favorite parts about those hobbies will help you understand me better as a person, I hope.         </p>

I have watched anime since I was a kid aswell, i guess it started when I first watched Dragon Ball Z.</br> 
I have seen so many anime's that have totally and completely captivated me keeping me on the edge of my seat till the very end.</br> 
So many of them tell such amazing stories that they actually make you care for the characters and what happens such as when reading a great book.</br> 
I used to watch them in english but as I got older I started to prefer watching it all in japanese with english subtitles.</br> 
Personally I believe it enchances the experience because I have found in translation to english dubbed you lose dialog and in a small way it alters the story.

		<td>OK, so i have been gaming for as long as I can remember, over 9 years at least.</br> 
This means I have no where near enough time to talk about all the games I love so I will just tell you about 1, my current favorite, League of Legends.</br> 
I have played over 2000 games of League of Legends, most games range anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour.</br>
I have been playing the game for over 
2 years and started just after the game came out of beta.</td>

		<td>	 Dismissed as a hopeless by those around him, 27-year-old Arata Kaizaki bounces around from one job to another after quitting his first company.</br>
			 His unremarkable existence takes a sharp turn when he meets Ryou Yoake, a member of the ReLife Research Institute, who offers Arata the opportunity to change his life for the better with the help of a mysterious pill.</br>
			 Taking it without a second thought, Arata awakens the next day to find that his appearance has reverted to that of a 17-year-old and goes back to High school.</br>
			 I really love this anime because it allows someone to get a second chance even though they have an unfulfilling life and use those experiences to shape their life for the better.
			 It was also an emotional roller coaster, made me feel emotions i haven't felt before. I am still looking for the next anime that makes me feel what i felt again,maybe even more.
