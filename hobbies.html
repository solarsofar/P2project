<p>	I'm not that interesting so don't expect too much.</br> 
		My hobbies have always been gaming, watching anime and generally mucking around on my pc, as such I find it fitting that I should tell you about such things.</br> 
		I honestly had not much of a life before I came to Highschool, so telling you about the things I used to consume my time with and my favorite parts about those hobbies will help you understand me better as a person, I hope.         </p>

<p>
OK, so i have been gaming for as long as I can remember, over 10 years at least.</br> 
This means I have no where near enough time to talk about all the games I love so I will just tell you about 1, my current favorite, League of Legends.</br> 
I have played over 2000 games of League of Legends, most games range anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour so you do the math.</br>
I have been playing the game for over 2 years and started just after the game came out of beta.
</p>

<p>
I have watched anime since I was a kid aswell, i guess it started when I first watched Dragon Ball Z.</br> 
I have seen so many anime's that have totally and completely captivated me keeping me on the edge of my seat till the very end.</br> 
So many anime's tell such amazing stories that they actually make you care for the characters and what happens such as when reading a great book.</br> 
I used to watch them in english but as I got older I started to prefer watching it all in japanese with english subtitles.</br> 
Personally I believe it enchances the experience because I have found in translation to english dubbed you lose dialog and in a small way it alters the story.
