    <p>I was born and spent a good chunck of my life in Benin Africa.</br>The city was cotonou It really is a lovely place for <i>some</i> people.</br>
	The climate is fairly warm with mild warm breeze on the coast. </br>Newcommers will most likely feel very out of touch because this country is 
	very community based.</br> Not being part of a community can make life difficuld due to the individualistic style of the place.</p>
<p> Our traditiosn are fairly fun and interesting.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Music is very importance in the country.</br> 
The rhythmic sounds of drumming can be heard at most festivals and religious events.</br> 
Not just a way to celebrate, music in Benin provides a way to express religious fervor.</li>
  <li>The strong influence of the Voodoo religion is an important part of Benin, which tells of healing and rejuvenating talismans.</br> 
	The tradition of oral storytelling is still alive and well, we prides ourselves in its ancient stories and folklore.</li>
  <li>As with most clothing in West Africa, the textiles are vibrant and ornately decorated.</br>  
	Each cultural group, be it Fon, Yoruba, or Edo, has unique but recognizable attire.</br> 
	in most tribes, different colors and patterns are worn for different occasions.</li>
</ul>
